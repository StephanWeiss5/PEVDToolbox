INSTALLATION

Please unpack the archived files in a folder, and ensure that three subdirectories /General, /Decompositions, and /Demos are added to the Matlab path using e.g.

path(path,'<InstallationDir>/General'); 

where <InstallationDir> represents the directory in which the unpacked files reside.

DOCUMENTATION

Please point your browser to Docs/index.html for information on the toolbox and a simple manual of the enclosed files.
