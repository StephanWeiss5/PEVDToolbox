  <h1>Polynomial EVD and Algorithms</h1>

  <p>Polynomial matrices arise, for example, in many broadband array
     or multichannel signal processing problems, where explicit lags
    between channels need to be considered, and the phase difference
    captured by a (narrowband) instantaneous covariance matrix would
    be insufficient. The resulting space-time covariance matrix
    therefore contains auto- and cross-correlation sequences as
    entries; its z-transform, the cross power spectral density (CSD)
    matrix, is a polynomial matrix. The symmetry structure of this
    matrix is an extension of the Hermitian property to a
    parahermitian matrix: the polynomial matrix identical to its
    Hermitian transposed, time reversed version.</p>

    <p>This toolbox provides algorithms to extend the utility of the
    eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) to the polynomial case via a
    polynomial EVD (PEVD). The PEVD provides a factorisation of a
    parahermitian matrix 
    $$
       \small{\boldsymbol{R}(z) \approx \boldsymbol{H}(z)
       \boldsymbol{D}(z) \tilde{\boldsymbol{H}}(z)}
    $$
    where \(\small{\boldsymbol{H}(z)}\) is a paraunitary matrix such
that the product with its parahermitian, \(\small{\tilde{\boldsymbol{H}}(z)}\),
    yields \(\small{\boldsymbol{H}(z)\tilde{\boldsymbol{H}}(z)=\mathbf{I}}\).
    The parahermitian \(\small{\boldsymbol{D}(z)}\) is diagonalised 
    $$
      \small{\boldsymbol{D}(z) = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
              D_1(z) & & & \\
               & D_2(z) & & \\
               & & \ddots & \\
               & & & D_M(z)
              \end{array} \right]}
    $$
    and spectrally majorised such that the power spectral densities
    \(\small{D_m(e^{j\Omega}) =D_m(z)|_{z=e^{j\Omega}}}\) are ordered at
    all frequencies:
    $$
       \small{D_m(e^{j\Omega}) \geq D_{m+1}(e^{j\Omega}) \qquad
         \forall m=1 \dots (M-1) \quad \forall \Omega} \quad.
    $$
    The approximation sign in the PEVD factorisation can generally be achieved
    well with FIR paraunitary matrices of sufficiently high order.</p>

    <p> The iterative PEVD algorithms within this toolbox fall into two families of algorithms:
    2nd order sequential best rotation (SBR2) and sequential matrix
    diagonalisation (SMD) algorithms. Iterative by nature, these
    algorithms will aim to diagonalise a parahermitian matrix by means
    of paraunitary (i.e. lossless) matrices. All algorithms have been
    proven to convergence towards a diagonal matrix. Additionally,
    both SBR2 and SMD algorithms enforce (but cannot guarantee)
    spectral majorisation, i.e. the power spectral densities along the
    main diagonal of the CSD matrix will be strictly order at all
    frequencies.</p>

    <p>Please note that the SBR2 algorithm is subject of a patent
    owned by QinetiQ. QinetiQ has given permission for its free use in
    university research, but at present its use in a commercial
    application without license from QinetiQ would be an infringement
    of the patent.</p>
