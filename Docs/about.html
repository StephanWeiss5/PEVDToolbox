  <h1>Polynomial EVD Toolbox</h1>

  <p>This toolbox contains a number of Matlab implementations of iterative algorithms to approximate
    the polynomial eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a parahermitian matrix.
    Parahermitian matrices arise e.g. when formulating covariance matrices
    for broadband array signals, and the term parahermitian hints as an extension
    of the (narrowband) Hermitian property to an generalised symmetry property of
    the polynomial matrix case.</p>

    <p>The toolbox files are organised in four subdirectories:
    <ul><li>"General" contains a number of utility functions to generate, manipulate
       and display polynomial matrices;</li>
       <li>"Decompositions" contains the two decomposition algorithms, SBR2 and SMD;
         these algorithms continue to evolve with various options, and are provided 
        within this toolbox as p-code, i.e. are executable but cannot be viewed;</li>
       <li>"Demos" provides a number of examples of how to apply the PEVD algorithms
         to a number of applications;</li>
       <li>"Docs" contains an auto-generated html documentation of the tool box. This
        manual can be navigated using the lower menu in the left sidebar.</li>
     </ul></p>

   <p>To find out more about the PEVD, the contained algorithms, the toolbox license
    and related issues, please follow the links provided on the left.</p>

   <p>We hope that you find this toolbox useful, and we look forward to any comments
     or feedback. </p>
